# Glucose Goblins

Glucose Goblins is a React Native app designed to gamify blood sugar management by integrating with Nightscout to display blood glucose levels in real time. Think of it as a Tamagotchi for managing diabetes! The better your blood sugar levels, the more points you can earn to care for and customize your virtual goblin. 

## Features

- **Nightscout Integration**: Real-time blood sugar data displayed at the top of the screen.
- **Goblin Care**: Earn points based on blood sugar control and use them to dress up, feed, and shower your glucose goblin.
- **Customizable Goblin**: Spend your points to interact with and personalize your goblin.
